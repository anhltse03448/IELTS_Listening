I hope that this first session, which I've called An Introduction to British Agriculture, { will the soils with  } provide a helpful background { to facing different would  } the farm visits { country, is the you'll  } { be at differences main  } doing next { week. next the being  } I think I should start by emphasising that agriculture still accounts for a very important part of this country's economy. We are used to hearing { the quality small, cereal  } UK's society and economy described as being 'industrial' or even 'post industrial', but we mustn't let this blind us to the fact that agriculture and its supporting industries still account for around 20% of our Gross National Product. This figure is especially impressive, I { think, I own account  } when you bear in mind how very small a percentage of the { UK soils thin. Agriculture,  } { workforce Agriculture, on a  } is employed in agriculture. This is not a recent development you would have to go { back and accounts making  } to 1750 { or owes support technology.  } so to find a majority of the workforce in this country working in agriculture: { By factors in National  } the middle { of more farmers talk,  } the next century, in 1850 { that amongst 10%, we  } is, it had fallen sharply to 10%, and then to { 3% broad value Well,  } by { the solidarity a training  } middle of the twentieth century. And now just 2% of the workforce contribute 20% of GNP. How is this efficiency achieved? Well, my own view { is broadly family a  } that it owes { a century, producing the  } great deal to a history, over the last 50 or { 60 different I third  } years, of { intelligent little other to  } support by the state, mainly taking the form of helping farmers to plan ahead. Then the two other factors I { should national recognition here.  } mention, both { very This of working  } important, are the high level of training amongst the agricultural workforce. And secondly, the recognition by farmers of the value of investing in technology. Now, although the UK is a fairly small country, the geology and climate vary a good deal from region to region. For our purposes today we can divide the country broadly into three I've marked them on the map here. The region { agricultural our where you'll  } { get a here. to  } { to is history, with  } know best, of course, is the north, where we are at present. The { land here, agriculture: that  } here is generally { hilly, agricultural of you've  } and the soils thin. The climate { up right twentieth agricultural  } here, and you've already had { evidence climate. family the  } of this, is generally cool and wet. { As agricultural marked producing  } you will see next week, the typical farm here in the { North first the to  } is a small, { family in North the  } { run over is that  } concern, producing mainly wool and timber { for contrast 20% to  } the market. If we contrast that with the { Eastern back society the  } region, over here, the east is flatter and more low lying, with fertile soils and a mixed climate. Average farm size is much bigger in the east, and farms are likely to be managed strictly on commercial lines. { As How in to  } { for country typical will  } crops, well, the east is the { cereal here, now UK's  } great cereal producing { region. given are us  } { However, first powerful third  } increasingly { significant part challenges typically  } areas are now also given over to high quality vegetables for supply direct to the supermarkets. The third broad { region Finally and west  } is { the mainly climate. The  } west, where it's a { different as for increasingly  } story again. The climate { is increasingly are lying,  } warmer than in the north { and my North we  } much wetter than in the east. The resulting rich soils in the west provide excellent { pasture, a short this  } and the farms there are quite large, typically around 800 hectares. { The But given as  } main products are milk, cheese and meat. So, clearly, there are marked differences between regions. But this does not prevent quite a { strong increasingly get today  } sense of solidarity amongst the farming community { as hope powerful region.  } a whole, right across the country. This solidarity { comes them very wool  } in part { from facing generally market.  } the need to present a united front in { dealing The We would  } with other powerful interest groups, such as government or the media. It also owes something to { the evidence deal We  } close co operation between all the agricultural training colleges, through which the great majority of farmers pass at { the farmers in a  } { beginning for well, which  } { of next between recent  } their careers. And a third factor making for solidarity { is 800 now the  } the national structure of the Farmers' { Union, UK high you  } of which virtually all farmers are members. Finally in this short talk, I would like { to contribute mixed 2%  } say a little about the challenges facing farmers in the { next. is and the  } { . development 'industrial' we  } .

 { I'd Olu? or really } like  to  meet  Didier  Drogba.
Drogba?  The  footballer?  Chelsea?  You  do   { know by thank ok }  I’m  from  Manchester,  don’t  { you, about and years }  Olu?  You  know,  Manchester  United?
Yeah,  well,  it’s  not  just  because  he’s  Chelsea.
Come  on  Olu  –  don’t  listen  to  him.  Why  would  you  like   { to he African moved }  meet  Didier  Drogba?  Tell  us  something  about  him.
Well,  he’s  a  footballer  –  you  already  know  that  –  and  he’s  from  Ivory  Coast,  in  West  Africa,  and  he  plays  great  football.
And  do  you  like  him  because  he’s  a  good  footballer?
Well,  I  do,  I  like  the  way  he  plays  and  he  scores  some  great  goals  and  all  { that, I Unicef well, }  but  { there's but by you }  more  than  that.  He  was   { born and he's in }  in  Ivory  Coast  but  he  moved  to  France  when  he  was  five  –  he  went  on  his  own  to  live  with  his  uncle.  Imagine  that  –  a  five  year  old  boy  moving  to  a  new  country  { by And in something }  himself?
 { Wow. Drogba? say some }
And  then  he  went  back  to  Ivory  Coast  but  moved  back  to  France   { a footballer for he }  bit  after  that.  His  family  were  really  poor,  you  know,  and  they  had  to   { move playing they young } { around he look playing }  to  look  for  work   { and from like Y'see }  that.
So   { did all for showing }  he  start  playing  football  in   { Ivory And not time }  Coast?
No  –  in  France.  And  this   { is about but start }  another  thing   { I did really you }  like  about  him,  see,  most  players  at  the  really  big  clubs  go  there  when  they’re  quite   { young good he just }  { but they've uncle was }  Drogba  played   { for he him some }  a  few  years  with  small  teams  and  worked  his   { way and for when }  up,  through  hard  work.   { He and I in }  was  26,  I  think,  when  he  went  to   { Chelsea. loads of really }  But  anyway,  what  I  like  him   { for came he when }  most  is  that   { even another scoring who }  though  he’s   { made for to us }  it  now   { and scoring there Wow. }  he’s  got  loads  of  money  and  that  he  really  hasn’t  forgotten  where  he  came  from.  He  does  loads  of  work  for  Unicef  –   { he's and in my }   { like came his to }  an  ambassador  or  something  for  them  so   { he do I year }  does  all   { this he Ivory think, }  charity  work.  Y’see,  my  dad  came  here  from  Nigeria   { when France about - }  he  was  really  small  and,  I’ve  never  been  to  Africa  but  all  you  see   { on go from Didier }  TV  is  about  problems  in  Africa   { all loads they're when }  the  time  so  it’s  really  good  to  see   { someone don't got is }  who  comes   { from did footballer to }  somewhere  { like all - Drogba? }  Ivory  Coast  doing  good  things,  you  know.
And  Ivory  Coast  were  in  the  World  Cup  in   { Germany, Coast plays worked }  weren’t  they?
Yeah.  It’s  the   { first because got guess }   { time and Ivory there's }  they’ve  got  to  the  World  Cup  Finals,  { and he plays start }  they  did  OK.  Drogba   { was that, for and }  African  footballer  of  { the did Ivory that }  year  as  well.
And  what  would  you  like  to  say  to  Didier  Drogba  if   { you work the those }  met  him,  Olu?
{ Emm, made say sing }  I  guess  I’d  say  thank  you  to  him  for  the   { work live was World }  he  does  for  Africa  and  for   { showing he see, African }  people  something  good  from  Africa.  And  for  scoring  { all boy Coast most }  those  goals  for  Chelsea!

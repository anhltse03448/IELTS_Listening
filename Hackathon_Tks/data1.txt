Welcome  to  Manham  Port,  where  a  thousand   { a b c d }   { a b c d }  history  are  brought  to  life.  All  the  family  can   { a b c d }  a  { a b c d }  out  at  Manham:  visit  our  copper  mine,  see  models  of   { a b c d }  machinery  it  used,  have  your   { a b c d }  taken  in  nineteenth   { a b c d }  costume,  experience  at  first  hand  how   { a b c d }  lived  at  different  stages  throughout  history,  and  especially  how  children  studied,   { a b c d }  and  played.
The  port  of  Manham  is  located  in  beautiful  and  peaceful  countryside,   { a b c d }  a  bend  in  the   { a b c d }  River  Avon,  { a b c d }  developed  here  because  it’s  the   { a b c d }  navigable  point   { a b c d }  the  Avon  boats  can  go  no  higher  up  this  river  and  proved   { a b c d }  handy  place  to  load  and  unload  cargo  to  and  from  the  sea,   { a b c d }  is  over  23   { a b c d }  away.
A  small  port   { a b c d }   { a b c d }  established  here  when,  about  900  years  ago,  tin  was   { a b c d }  nearby,  though  it  wasn’t  until  the  Industrial  Revolution,  when  a  tremendous  need   { a b c d }  metals  of  all  kinds  developed,  that  Manham  expanded  to  { a b c d }  one  of  the  busiest  ports  in  the  country.
And  because   { a b c d }  was   { a b c d }  so  busy,  prospectors  began   { a b c d }  look  for  other  minerals,  and  by  the  { a b c d }  of  the  nineteenth   { a b c d }  lead,  copper,  manganese   { a b c d }  arsenic  were  added  to   { a b c d }  cargos  leaving  Manham.
In  the  early  days,  the  ores  had  been  smelted  or  processed   { a b c d }  the  same  area  they  were  mined.   { a b c d }  as  demand  grew,  the  smelting   { a b c d }  required  huge  factory  furnaces  or  fires  to  melt  the  metal  from  the  rock   { a b c d }  there  was  not  enough   { a b c d }  in  the   { a b c d }  area,  so  the  rocks  containing  minerals  had  to  be  shipped  Iona  distances.
{ a b c d }  in  the  twentieth  century,  the  great  port  of  Manham  declined,  and  thousands  of  workers   { a b c d }  forced  to  emigrate  { a b c d }  of  the  area.
The  building  at  the  port  fell  into  disrepair,  and  the  place  became  almost  forgotten.  But  then,  the  Manham   { a b c d }  was  formed  to  conserve  the  historical  resources  of   { a b c d }  area.   { a b c d }  organised  scores  of   { a b c d }  volunteers  to  remove  undergrowth  to  find  the  original  outlines   { a b c d }   { a b c d }  installations.  It  then  brought  in  paid  professionals  to  match  installations  { a b c d }  maps  of  the  original   { a b c d }  complex   { a b c d }  to   { a b c d }  about  reconstructing  it.
Today   { a b c d }  can  see  the  results   { a b c d }  this  ambitious  programme  of  restoration.
The  intention,  and  we  believe  this  will  be  realised  before  the  end  of  the  year,  is  to  return  Manham  Port  to  the  condition  it  reached  at  its  peak  as  'the  greatest  copper  port  in  the  country’.

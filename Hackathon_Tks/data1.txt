Well,  I’ve  been  talking  to  managers  in  a   { a b c d }  of  businesses,  and  reading   { a b c d }  about  the  future  of  management.  And  { a b c d }  I'm  going  to  present  in  this  seminar  is  a  few  ideas  about  how  the  activity  is  likely  to  change  in  the  next   { a b c d } years.  It  isn't  a  scientific,  statistical   { a b c d }  just  some  ideas  for   { a b c d }  to   { a b c d }
One  area  I  want   { a b c d }  mention  is  business  markets,  and  I’m  sure  a  really  significant  development  will  be  a  major  increase  in  competition,  with  companies  from  all  round  the  world  trying   { a b c d }  sell  similar   { a b c d }
Consumers  will  have  much  more   { a b c d }  for  instance,   { a b c d }  products  sold  in  Australia  might  be  manufactured  in  the  USA,  China,  Finland  and  dozens  of  other  countries.  At  the  same  time,  mergers   { a b c d }  takeovers  mean  that   { a b c d }  are  actually  losing   { a b c d }  to  major  global  corporations.
We  can  probably  all  think  of  companies  that  exert  a  great  deal  of  influence,  which   { a b c d }  be  good  for  consumers.
{ a b c d }  third   { a b c d }  I  want  to  make  about  markets  is  that   { a b c d }  the  rapidly  expanding  economies,  such  as  { a b c d }  China.  Brazil  and  Russia,   { a b c d }  is   { a b c d }  very  fast.
This  is  putting   { a b c d }  on  resources  all  over  the  world.   { a b c d }  think   { a b c d }  are  becoming  more  open  to  external  influences.  In  particular,  companies  are  consulting  customers  more  and  more  before  making  their  business  decisions.
Companies  are  finding  out  what   { a b c d }  want  and  providing   { a b c d }  instead   { a b c d }  making  products  and  then  trying  to  sell  them,  which  is  the  model   { a b c d }  years   { a b c d }
Another  influence  is  that  concerns   { a b c d }  the  environment  will  force  manufacturers   { a b c d }  extend  product,  lifecycles,  to  reduce   { a b c d }  amount  of  pollution  and  waste.  And  in  some  cases,  regulation  will  need  to  be   { a b c d }
Many  societies  are  much  more  fluid  and  democratic,  and  the  structure  of  companies  is  changing  to  reflect  that.  I  think   { a b c d }  going  to  see  a   { a b c d }  emphasis  within  companies  on  teams  created   { a b c d }  a  specific   { a b c d }  in  mind.
And  when  they're  completed,   { a b c d }  teams  will  be  disbanded  and  new  ones  formed.
More  and  more  people   { a b c d }  work  as  simply  one  part  of  their  lifestyle,  and  not  the  most  important  one,  and  as   { a b c d } workforce  is  shrinking  in  some  countries,  businesses  are  having  to  compete  for  staff  instead  of  being  able  to  choose   { a b c d }  a  lot  of  applicants.  Typical  examples  that  will  attract  and   { a b c d }  staff  are  traditional  ones  like   { a b c d }  hours  and  something  that  has  been  made  possible  by  advances   { a b c d }  technology  remote  working,  with  people  based  at   { a b c d }  home,  abroad,  or  almost  anywhere   { a b c d }  choose.
Management  styles  will  almost  certainly  continue  to  change.  Senior  managers  will  require  a  lot  more  than  the  efficiency  that  they’ve  always  needed.  Above  all  they'll  need  great  skills  in  leadership,  so  that  their  organisation  can  initiate  and  respond  to  change  in  a  fast  { a b c d }  world,  where  they  face  lots  of  competing  requirements  and  potential  conflicts.
In  most  of  the  world,  the  senior  managers  of   { a b c d }  businesses  are  mainly  men  in  their  fifties  and  sixties.  The  predominant  style  of  { a b c d }  will   { a b c d }  certainly  become   { a b c d }  consultative  and   { a b c d }  caused  above  all,  by  more  women  moving  into  senior  management  positions.
{ a b c d }  of   { a b c d }  changes  are  influenced  by  developments  in  the  wider   { a b c d }  The  traditional  emphasis  of  business  was  manufacturing,  and  of  course  the   { a b c d }  sector  is  very  important.  But  we  shouldn’t   { a b c d }  the  growing   { a b c d } contribution   { a b c d }  IP,  that   { a b c d }   { a b c d }  property.  Some  books  and  films  generate  enormous   { a b c d }  from  the   { a b c d }   { a b c d }  related  DVDs,  music,  games,  clothes,  and  so  on.
Another  point  I’d  like   { a b c d }  make  is   { a b c d }  although  I’ve  been  talking  about  companies,  one   { a b c d }  that  they  have  to  face  is  the  move   { a b c d }  from  people  working  for  the  same  employer  for  years.  Instead,   { a b c d }  and  more  people  are  becoming  self  employed,  to  gain  the  freedom  and  control  over  their  lives  that  they’re  unlikely  to  get  from  being  employed.
{ a b c d }  well  that's  all  I  want  to  say,  so  let’s  open   { a b c d }  up  for  discussion.

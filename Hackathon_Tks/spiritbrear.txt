Today, the { a bears it spirit  } bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands. There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment in other words, their ecosystem. The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of { British its of the  } habitat.

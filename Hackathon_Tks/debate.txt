Over the last few weeks we discussed { a if may tells  } method for teaching debate to English learners. Debate is a valuable wayChoose a word an case the to { to practice fans. valuable  } communicating. It can also bring long lasting { and much rewards that  } outside the classroom, especially for people working with Western businesses. The main activity of debate is { able criticize job presenting  } one's opinion and supporting it with evidence, such as statistics { an do had or  } facts. It is a way of persuasive communication – { activity of to with  } making someone believe what you are saying. { Charles it that use  } Lebeau { each helped order what  } create the "Discover Debate" method. He says debate { and for is the  } important to understanding how people communicate in Western { be business. point wonderful  } Successful debaters learn how to give { and life point. their  } opinion, reasons and support. "What we { are He Monday, the  } trying to do is to develop a kind of thinking or approach to discussion and how to interact with someone else’s opinion, rather than brush their opinion aside and say, “well { than the to yes,  } but this is what I think." Debate skills { and are the Three  } { also ask me?" Then,  } important { a Debate in make  } selling a product, he says. In that situation, the judges are the customers. "So on Monday, for { at example, point their  } one company may come in and present { selling teaching their way  } case to the customer and they'll make as { don't explain strong what  } a case as they can. On Tuesday, the next day, another company { have will with you  } come in and { evidence, present to yes,  } their case to the customer. Usually the party that can present the strongest { case discussion example, participants  } wins." He { adds class learn think  } that people { be of use with  } persuasive communication in meetings, too. { can debate On Three  } or four people may present ideas. Then, they { attack criticize for One  } or support each other's { also arguments. in of  } "I think { how participants this we  } way of approaching presenting opinions and responding to opinions, is very important for English speaking. In Japan, we don't really do that, we don't respond to a person point by point. In English style { In meetings, not the  } we do do that and Japanese participants need to do that in { an debate to trying  } English style meeting in order to be successful." Debate { also do so that  } { criticize lasting strengthens the  } { ask critical really to  } thinking. In other words, it helps students learn to ask questions andChoose a word helps say, to try { it long to university.  } understand someone's reasons and evidence. Mr. Lebeau points out { Debate kind She that  } successful debaters learn { to shoes. the person  } listen { an carefully each Three  } to what other people are saying. Then, they look for the weak points in someone else's opinion or argument. He { says sport the young  } debate teaches a systematic way of questioning. Successful debaters also learn to { at Professor support think  } from someone else's { baseball." opinions, people point  } of view. Mr. { argue in Lebeau tells  } says debate can { day, help me?" to  } broaden { a In the thinking  } mind. "There's an expression { for in point points  } { debaters English: how they  } don't criticize another { or people person than  } before you have walked in their shoes. I think the wonderful { a main need thing  } about debate is, it puts us in another person's shoes." For example, students in a debate might argue the topic { "soccer evidence. Western with  } is a better sport than { and are baseball." even  } A student may have to argue in favor of soccer, even if he or she does not really think soccer is better than baseball. But { do the understanding Usually  } student will have to { company. debate explain the  } why soccer is an interesting { responding sport to Usually  } { and case exercise the  } { an present viewpoint way  } the viewpoint of soccer fans.

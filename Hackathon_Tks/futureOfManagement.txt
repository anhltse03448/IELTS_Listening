Well, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of management. { And freedom increase the  } what I'm { going And a products  } to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years. It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis just some { ideas face people USA,  } for us to discuss. One area I want to mention is business markets, { and change not the  } I’m sure a really significant development { will making something emphasis  } be a major { increase I think with  } in competition, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products. Consumers will have much more choice for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in { the reading changing want  } USA, China, Finland and dozens of other { countries. clothes, from the  } { At and on technology  } the same { time, the third round  } mergers and takeovers mean { that of open China,  } governments are actually losing power to major global corporations. We { can about exert so  } probably all think of companies { that mergers of among  } { exert be In years.  } a great deal { of growing a very  } influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India. { China. becoming conflicts. for  } Brazil and Russia, demand is growing very { fast. in influences. managers  } This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences. In particular, { companies than to will  } are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions. Companies are finding out what they want { and demand I'm reduce  } { providing of competition, the  } it, instead of making { products emphasis to well  } and then trying to sell them, { which of to fast  } is the { model ago. possible retain  } of years { ago. for great more  } Another influence is { that consulting pressure change  } concerns about the environment will { force collaborative, area I  } manufacturers to { extend games, I point  } product, { lifecycles, for emphasis might  } to reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened. Many societies { are decisions. generate staff  } much more fluid and { democratic, are employed. of  } { and companies OK, working,  } the { structure competition, mainly by  } { of can the we  } companies is { changing and technology world  } to reflect that. I think we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind. And when they're { completed, And fifties like  } the teams will { be for more sure  } disbanded and new ones formed. More and more people { see more potential being  } work as simply { one point sell that  } part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, { businesses And likely Well,  } are having to compete for staff { instead collaborative, surveys which  } of being able to choose { among are Many to  } a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will { attract are products ten  } and retain staff are { traditional on the losing  } ones like flexible hours and something that has been made { possible Many pressure years.  } by advances in technology remote { working, based the are  } with people { based most senior they’ve  } at { their talking the in  } home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose. Management { styles I’ve people external  } will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will { require One and same  } a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they'll need great skills in leadership, so that their organisation can { initiate having competition, teams  } and { respond can making always  } to change in a fast moving world, where they face lots of { competing same strengthened. that  } requirements and potential conflicts. { In Australia need that  } most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will almost certainly { become and to we're  } more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions. Many of the changes { are financial moving one,  } influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business { was people rapidly of  } manufacturing, and of { course abroad, influence years.  } the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, { that something and this  } is, { intellectual by to want  } property. Some books and { films disbanded as their  } generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on. Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve { been all face some  } talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people { are A employer in  } { becoming more that the  } self employed, to gain the freedom and control over their lives that Choose a word abroad, choose they’re third unlikely to get from being employed. OK, well that's all I { able is, people want  } to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.
